# Theme Description:
This wordpress template has MinifyPHP installed, it compiles CSS/JS files fast and without any additional program.

* The MinifyPHP library is included in function.php
* Added glob function to grab files (.css / .js) and not have to add files one by one.
* Only the files in the directories (../css/ and ../js/) should be edited.
* Once in production the theme will compile the files (css/js) inside the directory (../minified/), where the css / js directories are respectively with the files (css/min.css) & (js/min .js).
